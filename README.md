👋 Hi there!

I'm a believer in the power of programming as a tool for problem-solving. 

When coding I draw inspiration from the wisdom of Donald Knuth: *'Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do.'* 💯

While a continuously iterative process it drives me to write clean, readable code that's friendly to both computers and humans. (sometimes successfully 🙃)

💪 A few years ago, I embraced fasting and meditation🧘‍♂️, and it's been a transformative experience. I wish I had started even earlier! I strive to live by three principles: Curiosity👀, Arete (excellence)💯, and Kindness✨.

💻 Currently, I'm immersing myself in JavaScript and Node.js at Launch School🚀. But my interests extend beyond any single language or framework. I'm a tech enthusiast and lifelong learner, always open to exploring new realms of knowledge.

📚 When I'm not coding, you might find me engrossed in a book or practicing my woodworking skills. I believe in the power of curiosity and continuous learning in all aspects of life.

👯 I'm looking forward to collaborating on open-source projects and contributing to the vibrant community here on GitHub. I firmly believe that teamwork makes the dream work!

🤣 Fun fact about me: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under a minute. I'm still searching for a software problem that's harder to crack!

As Maya Angelou wisely said, "This is a wonderful day. I've never seen this one before."✨ Here's to making the most of each day and the exciting journey of learning and growing together.

🖖😎
