👋 Hi there!

I'm a believer in the power of programming as a tool for problem-solving.(and occasionally problem-creating!🐞 😂) 

I draw inspiration from the wisdom of Donald Knuth: *'Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do.'* 🙌 While an iterative process it drives me (sometimes successfully 🙃) to write clean, readable code that's friendly to both computers and humans.

I strive to live by: Curiosity👀, Arete (excellence)💯, and Kindness✨.

💻 Currently, I'm immersing myself in JavaScript and Node.js at Launch School🚀. But my interests extend beyond any single language or framework. I'm a lifelong learner.

📚 When I'm not coding, you might find me sitting in nature🌳, listening to an audiobook🎵, or in pursuit of something else that brings me joy. I believe in the power of curiosity.👀

👯 I look forward to contributing to the vibrant dev community. I passionately believe that (good) teamwork makes the dream work!✨

*"This is a wonderful day. I've never seen this one before."* -Maya Angelou✨

🖖😎
